Connect
=======
The idea of this project is to connect people with actions instead of messages. Here is the brief description of the app

The app should have some list of predetermined actions that the users wants to do and if he selects any of the action and if any of his/her friends who has the app installed select the same action, both will be notified.

e.g: Say User 1 wants to go to Coffee but doesn't have a company or hesitant to ask anyone for a coffee.
 User 2, who is on User 1's friends list also selects coffee within a pre set time from user 1 action. Then we will pair these two actions and notify the users.
 
 The idea is to have a bunch of pre listed actions and different logics. 
 
 The app will have integrations with facebook, linked in, twitter to get friends list. In addtion, we can use phone number or email address to sign up.
 
 Some list of pre set actions that i was thinking in no particular order.
 
Wanna go Coffee?
Hungry, Let's eat!
Need Help!
Want to Help!
Wanna go Movie?

Let us know your thoughts and we don't know how complex this project would be but we are more than happy to strecth to give this a shot.
